# <Password-Generator>

## Description

This password was an on-the-job type scenario where I went into existing code and added JS logic to create random passwords. This project will assist in delivering quality, random passwords that useres are searching for. The bulk of the logic is a series of if statements that confirm the users choices for specifics on their chosen input types.

## Usage

To use this application the user will visit the webpage and follow the designated prompts for what inputs the user would like to select.
